# CalculatorApp

This was a simple first project I created to just get something on github.

This is a working beta version. Here is a list of changes I plan on making down the road:

Overall Project Tasks:
	1. Make it an executable application
  2. Make individual test cases
	3. Clean up GUI code and comments
	4. Font size increase with window resize
		a. Or change text to pictures that resize with window
	5. Disable button if it can't be pressed or flash red if it's an invalid selection
	6. Find a way to store the button design parameters in a list, map, etc... to use that in each button variable
    a.Ex: tk.Button()

Tasks I might do in the future:
	1. Create parser for equations instead of using eval()
		a. Currently checking open/closed parenthesis match isn't in code as it's outside the scope of regex
